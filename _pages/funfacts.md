Academic Adventures
======
- :traffic_light: **First Rejection and Acceptance**: My first rejection came in Dec 2017, followed by a milestone achievement when *Personality and Individual Differences* accepted my first paper in October 2018.
- :clock130: **Longest Waiting Period**: Endured a 21-month wait before the first revision, a true test of patience. 
- :trophy: **Most Challenging Revision**: Embraced three rounds of revisions that not only significantly improved the paper’s quality but also taught me valuable lessons in reviewing academic work ([in case you are interested](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-019-00192-w)).

Hobbies
======
- :tv: **Anime**: My current year favorite anime is [Frieren: Beyond Journey's End (葬送のフリーレン)](https://frieren-anime.jp/).
- :notebook: **Journaling**: My current year favorite journal brand is Hobonichi.
- :thread: **Sewing**: Just repaired my friend's pants that ripped from skiing and made a grocery bag using free sewing techniques.

If We Eat Together
======
- :cup_with_straw: **Coke Zero Everyday**: I’ll make sure there’s Coke Zero on hand (not Diet Coke) for our 24-hour beverage supply.
- :fries: **Ice Cream Dip**: I enjoy the  combination of dipping ice cream in fries -- sweet and salty perfection!
- :ice_cream: **Favorite Ice Cream Flavors**: Let’s try my top three ice cream flavors together: peanut butter chocolate, rum raisin, and green tea.
