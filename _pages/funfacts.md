Academic Adventures
======
- First Rejection and Acceptance: My first rejection came in December 2017, followed by a milestone achievement when Personality and Individual Differences accepted my first paper in October 2018.
- Longest Waiting Period: Endured a 21-month wait before the first revision, a true test of patience. 
- Most Challenging Revision: Faced three rounds of revisions with an exceptionally thoughtful reviewer. Her/his feedback significantly improved the paper, making it one of my favorites ([in case you are interested](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-019-00192-w)).

Hobbies
======
- Anime, my current year favorite anime is [Frieren: Beyond Journey's End (葬送のフリーレン)](https://frieren-anime.jp/).
- Journaling, my current year favorite journal brand is [Hobonichi](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/).
- Sewing, just repaired my friend's pants that ripped from skiing and made a grocery bag using free sewing techniques.
