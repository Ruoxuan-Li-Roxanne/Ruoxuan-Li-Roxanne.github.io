My name is Ruoxuan (Roxanne) Li. Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Psychology program at the University of Notre Dame, where I have been studying since 2021. I am current under supervision of [Prof. Lijuan (Peggy) Wang](https://psychology.nd.edu/people/lijuan-wang/) at University of Notre Dame. I also work with [Prof. Margarita Alegría](https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/13971584/Margarita-Alegria) at Harvard Medical School, [Prof. Irene J. K. Park](https://medicine.iu.edu/indianapolis/faculty) at Indiana University School of Medicine, and [Prof. Tiffany Yip](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/tiffany-yip/) at Fordham University.


Research Interests
======
My research interests are focused on the application of advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques in psychology. Specifically, I have been working on dynamic structural equation models, causal inference, and the development of predictive models using deep learning. I am passionate about exploring how these methodologies can enhance our understanding of psychological processes and improve interventions in educational and health settings.
