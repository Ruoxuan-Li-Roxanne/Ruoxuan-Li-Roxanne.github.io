Research Interests
======
My research interests are focused on the application of advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques in psychology. Specifically, I have been working on dynamic structural equation models, causal inference, and the development of predictive models using deep learning. I am passionate about exploring how these methodologies can enhance our understanding of psychological processes and improve interventions in educational and health settings.  revise based on projects
